<H1> Installing the LDPC Software </H1>

The LDPC software is written in C, and may well work with any C
compiler, though it has been tested only in a Unix/Linux environment,
and in the <A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com">cygwin</A> Unix environment
that runs under Microsoft Windows.  The installation instructions
below assume that you are using a Unix-like system.

<P>All the software, including the documentation you are viewing here,
is contained in a Unix tar file, which you can download by clicking one
of the options below:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 <A HREF="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~radford/ftp/LDPC-yyyy-mm-dd/LDPC-yyyy-mm-dd.tar">Tar 
   file of LDPC software</A> (0.9 Megabytes)<BR>
 <A HREF="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~radford/ftp/LDPC-yyyy-mm-dd/LDPC-yyyy-mm-dd.tar.gz">Gzipped
   tar file of LDPC software</A> (0.4 Megabytes)
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Once you obtain the tar file (and uncompress it with gunzip if
necessary), you should extract the files with the following Unix command:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
tar xf LDPC-yyyy-mm-dd.tar
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
This will create a directory called <TT>LDPC-yyyy-mm-dd</TT>, and place
all the source, documentation, and other files in this directory.  

<P>If you prefer for this directory to be called something else,
rename it <B>now</B>, before compiling the programs, since the file
<TT>randfile</TT> in this directory, containing natural random numbers,
is accessed according to its path when the programs were compiled.

<P>Once the tar command above has finished, you should change into the
newly-created directory, and type 
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
make
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
If all goes well, this should compile all the programs (except for some
test programs).  

<P>The sub-directory <TT>bin</TT> contains symbolic links to all these
programs.  You might want to place it in the PATH variable used by
your shell to find programs.

<P>The LDPC directory contains a copy of all the HTML files
documenting the software, such as the one you are reading now, with
the file <TT>index.html</TT> being the starting point.  I recommended
that you use this local copy when referring to the documentation, rather
than get it from my web page.  Just tell your browser to open the URL
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
file:<I>path-to-software</I>/index.html
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
where <TT><I>path-to-software</I></TT> is the full path (starting with "/") 
to the directory where you've put the software.

<P>The command
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
make clean
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
will remove all the compiled programs, as well as the files created when
the <A HREF="examples.html">examples</A> are run, and <TT>core</TT>, if it 
exists.
